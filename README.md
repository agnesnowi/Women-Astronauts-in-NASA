# Women-Astronauts-in-NASA
From the movie Hidden Figures , we clearly see what an important role women played in serving as the brains behind one of the greatest operations in history: the launch of astronaut John Glenn into orbit, a stunning achievement that restored the nation's confidence, turned around the Space Race, and galvanized the world. But despite women being at the top of their game, they are still not as appreciated as their male counterparts and most of them have had to work twice as hard to get to where their male counterparts are.

We will study the number of Women Astronauts in Nasa using List of NASA astronauts from Nasa's Open Data Portal.

Although there are very many important jobs like engineering, mathematics, Nutrition specialists, accounting and many others in Nasa occupied by women, the entire analysis is only going to focus on astronauts.

The questions we address are:

Who was the first woman astronaut?
How many women astronauts in total have been part of the Nasa groups?
How many women (in total and as a percentage) were part of the main space exploration programs?
What is the current trend? Are more women hired as astronauts by Nasa and at what rate?
When will Nasa achieve gender balance in terms of women astronauts on space missions?


Executive summary
In 1978, six women were selected to join NASA Group 8. There was no woman selected to join the first seven groups.
Sally Ride became the first American woman to travel to space in 1983 even though she worked for NASA since 1978.
The percentage of women selected for NASA missions reached 50% in 2013 when the 21st group was created. It seems like there is a gender balance, but unfortunately we cannot rely on these statistics for sure since the number of people selected per group varies greatly.
